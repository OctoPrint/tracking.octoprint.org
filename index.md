title: Anonymous Usage Tracking in OctoPrint
---

Starting with version 1.3.10, OctoPrint comes with a built-in plugin "Anonymous Usage Tracking" that performs anonymous 
usage tracking. Tracking will only take place if the plugin is enabled and you've decided to opt-in during initial 
setup (or enabled it manually afterwards, through the corresponding switch in the settings).

#### What data gets recorded?

All tracking requests record the OctoPrint version and a unique identifier of the OctoPrint instance (randomly created on first
start and not connected in any way to personal identifiable information) to allow counting of unique instances per 
version. Additionally a rough location from which the request originates will be determined based on the client IP 
using the [GeoLite2 City database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) and 
[GeoIP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-geoip.html).

The plugin fires tracking requests for the following events. Version numbers indicate in which OctoPrint version after
1.3.10 an event or additional data was added, also for as of yet unreleased versions. Most of the events can be
switched off in the settings.
