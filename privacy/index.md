### Server log files

The web server automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in 
"server log files". These are:

  * Browser type and browser version
  * Operating system used
  * Referrer URL
  * Time of the server request
  * IP address
  
These log files are used for security measures and are deleted after 30 days.

These data will not be combined with data from other sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for 
measures preliminary to a contract.

### Tracking server for OctoPrint's Anonymous Usage Tracking plugin

The web server used as endpoint for OctoPrint's Anonymous Usage Tracking plugin collects the following information 
as sent by the plugin:

  * Time of the server request
  * Unique anonymous identifier generated randomly per OctoPrint instance
  * OctoPrint version
  * IP address
  * further unpersonalized data associated with each tracking event, such as print durations.
  
These log files are deleted after 30 days.

On further processing by the local analysis backend, this gets turned into the following data:

  * Time of the server request
  * Unique anonymous identifier generated randomly per OctoPrint instance
  * OctoPrint version
  * IP address
  * GeoIP data for the originating request
  * further unpersonalized data associated with each tracking event, such as print durations.

The IP address used to get stripped, however due to data manipulation by bad actors it turned out to be required
to be able to filter out bad data within the active tracking period. 

This processed data is deleted after 90 days. It will not be combined with data from other sources.

The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for 
measures preliminary to a contract.
